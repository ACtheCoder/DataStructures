binary_search_tree_int.c is going to be the first implementation of the
data structure I will be creating, since they will only be able to
be used on ints. The second implementation I plan on having will be
able to connected to an struct that will have a value the binary
search tree will use. The second implementation is called
binary_search_tree.c.
